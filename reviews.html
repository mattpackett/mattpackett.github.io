            <h3>Old House, New Back Yard<br/></h3>
            <p>"We have been living in our home for over 25 years and we felt we needed and update, now that we have grandkids.We wanted to create a warm and inviting place for the grandkids during summer nights. PFP was able to create this new AMAZING firepit for us! We can't wait to make "S'more" memories with the family."     -Skywalkers </p>
            <h3>Updating Older FirePits<br/></h3>
            <p>"I just bought my first home and wanted a place for my friends to come chill, while crack open some cold ones. I contact PFP with my idea and they were able to make it happen! I cannot wait until I can throw the best summer bash next to my new fire pit!!! " -Luke </p>
            <h3>Budget Friendly<br/></h3>
            <p>"Our old fire pit, at our family cabin, needed some major updates. After working with PFP, we were able to bring our dream alive and still keep under budget! PFP is worth every cent and provided the bang for the buck" - Han  </p>       
            <h3>Spare No Expence<br/></h3>
            <p>" I came to PFP with one idea in my head. I wanted the best and biggest fire pit that money could buy. Since working with PFP, they were able to deliver this idea for me. Know every time my fire pit is lite, my whole lake lights up. Now I just need to figure out how to stop the fire department from showing up!!!" - Lando</p>
